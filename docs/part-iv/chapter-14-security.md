# Chapter 14: Security, Isolation, and Policy Enforcement

*Secure your search stack with multi-tenant isolation, access control, encryption, and zero-trust design.*

## Chapter Overview

Search systems often contain sensitive data and must enforce strict access controls. This chapter covers the security models that protect search infrastructure, from role-based access control to zero-trust architectures.

Implementing proper security is non-negotiable for enterprise search deployments.

## 14.1 Access Control Models

**14.1.1** Index-level ACLs

**14.1.2** Role-based access control (RBAC)

**14.1.3** Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

## 14.2 Tenant Isolation

**14.2.1** Namespace partitioning

**14.2.2** Resource quotas and limits

**14.2.3** Isolation in multi-cloud environments

## 14.3 Secure Ingestion and Zero Trust

**14.3.1** AuthN and AuthZ at ingest

**14.3.2** Encrypted pipelines and bring-your-own-key (BYOK)

**14.3.3** Zero-trust deployment models

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate access control configuration, tenant isolation, and secure ingestion patterns with Lucenia.
