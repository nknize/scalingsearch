# Chapter 16: Cost Efficiency and System Resilience

*Design for durability and affordability without sacrificing performance or reliability.*

## Chapter Overview

Search infrastructure can be expensive to operate at scale. This chapter covers strategies for optimizing costs through storage tiering, compression, and efficient resource utilization, while maintaining the resilience needed for production workloads.

Balancing cost and performance is a continuous challenge that requires understanding the trade-offs at every layer.

## 16.1 Storage Tiers

**16.1.1** Hot, warm, and cold layouts

**16.1.2** Tier-based latency

**16.1.3** Storage and billing impact

## 16.2 Compression and Archival

**16.2.1** Document and segment deduplication

**16.2.2** Long-term archival strategies

**16.2.3** Compression tradeoffs for query speed

## 16.3 Disaster Recovery

**16.3.1** Snapshot and restore workflows

**16.3.2** Multi-region replication

**16.3.3** High-availability testing and game days

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate storage tiering, compression configuration, and disaster recovery procedures with Lucenia.
