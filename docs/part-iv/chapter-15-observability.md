# Chapter 15: Observability and Self-Healing Systems

*Monitor, debug, and adapt your search platform using metrics and automated recovery.*

## Chapter Overview

Operating search at scale requires deep visibility into system behavior and the ability to respond to issues automatically. This chapter covers the observability stack (metrics, tracing, and logs) along with self-healing patterns that keep systems running.

Building observable, self-healing systems is essential for maintaining reliability as your search infrastructure grows.

## 15.1 Metrics and Dashboards

**15.1.1** QPS, p99 latency, cache hit rates

**15.1.2** Refresh, flush, and latency statistics

## 15.2 Tracing and Logs

**15.2.1** Query tracing and sampling

**15.2.2** Indexing path analysis

**15.2.3** Slow query logs and heatmaps

## 15.3 Self-Healing Patterns

**15.3.1** Hot shard detection

**15.3.2** Adaptive throttling

**15.3.3** Auto-restart and reroute

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate metrics collection, query tracing, and self-healing configuration with Lucenia.
