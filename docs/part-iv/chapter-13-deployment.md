# Chapter 13: Deployment Patterns and Architectures

*Deploy search systems across environments with high availability and flexible scaling.*

## Chapter Overview

Search systems must run reliably across diverse environments, from on-premise data centers to multi-cloud deployments. This chapter covers deployment topologies, provisioning strategies, and the replication patterns that ensure high availability.

Understanding deployment patterns is essential for operating search infrastructure that meets your organization's reliability and compliance requirements.

## 13.1 Topologies

**13.1.1** On-prem and air-gapped

**13.1.2** Cloud and multi-zone

**13.1.3** Hybrid and edge patterns

## 13.2 Install and Provisioning

**13.2.1** Bare metal and serverless

**13.2.2** Containers and orchestration

**13.2.3** Auto-scaling and config tuning

## 13.3 Availability and Replication

**13.3.1** Zonal redundancy and regional replication

**13.3.2** Cold start and rebalance recovery

**13.3.3** Cross-cluster replication: why it exists, hidden costs, and better patterns

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate deployment configurations, container orchestration, and replication setup with Lucenia.
