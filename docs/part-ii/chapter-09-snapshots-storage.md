# Chapter 9: Snapshots and Storage Strategy

*Learn how snapshots and remote stores enable durability, cost savings, and scalable recovery.*

## Chapter Overview

Snapshots provide the foundation for backup, disaster recovery, and cost-effective storage tiering. This chapter covers snapshot mechanics, remote storage integration, and the strategies that enable both durability and rapid recovery.

Understanding snapshot strategies is critical for building search systems that can recover from failures and optimize storage costs.

## 9.1 Local vs. Remote Store Architecture

**9.1.1** Snapshot policies and compression

**9.1.2** Snapshot frequency and rotation

## 9.2 Restore and Warmup Behavior

**9.2.1** Cold start penalties

**9.2.2** Lazy segment recovery

**9.2.3** Preload strategies and cache priming

## 9.3 Cloud Storage Models

**9.3.1** Object storage

**9.3.2** Block storage

**9.3.3** Consistency, locking, and recovery races

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate snapshot creation, restoration, and cloud storage integration patterns with Lucenia.
