# Chapter 10: Hybrid Search: Fields, Vectors, and Filters

*Learn how to blend structured fields, full-text, and vector search into a single retrieval system.*

## Chapter Overview

Modern retrieval systems rarely rely on a single search modality. This chapter covers hybrid search: combining structured filters, full-text keyword search, and vector similarity into unified retrieval pipelines that leverage the strengths of each approach.

Mastering hybrid search is essential for building retrieval systems that power contextual AI applications.

## 10.1 Search Modes

**10.1.1** Exact vs. approximate nearest neighbor

**10.1.2** Keyword vs. embedding search

## 10.2 Vector Indexing

**10.2.1** Graphs, trees, and brute force

**10.2.2** Quantization and compression

**10.2.3** The curse of dimensionality

## 10.3 Hybrid Scoring

**10.3.1** Field + vector fusion

**10.3.2** Filter-first vs. score-first

**10.3.3** Real-world examples

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate vector indexing, hybrid query construction, and fusion scoring strategies with Lucenia.
