# Chapter 11: Retrieval for Contextual AI

*Understand how search provides grounding context for large language models and other AI systems.*

## Chapter Overview

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a foundational design pattern for AI applications. This chapter covers how search systems provide the context layer that grounds LLMs in facts, from embedding stores to context window optimization.

Understanding retrieval for contextual AI is critical as over 60% of enterprises deploying LLMs now integrate vector-based or hybrid search.

## 11.1 Context and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**11.1.1** Context windows and model context protocols

**11.1.2** How RAG works

## 11.2 Embedding Stores

**11.2.1** Chunking and splitting

**11.2.2** Vector ingestion

**11.2.3** Refresh and expiry

## 11.3 Performance at Scale

**11.3.1** Metadata + vector binding

**11.3.2** Search latency vs. LLM latency

**11.3.3** Pipeline optimization

## Examples

*Examples coming soon.*

Code examples for this chapter will demonstrate RAG pipeline construction, embedding management, and performance optimization with Lucenia and LLM integrations.
