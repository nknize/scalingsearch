# Chapter 1: What Is a Search Engine, Really?

*Understand the foundational responsibilities and evolving role of search engines in modern systems and AI applications.*

## Chapter Overview

This chapter establishes the foundation for everything that follows. Before diving into data structures, distributed systems, or AI integration, you need to understand what a search engine actually does and how its role has evolved from simple keyword matching to powering contextual AI systems.

Search engines are no longer just tools for finding documents. They are retrieval systems that provide the essential context layer for AI inference, log analysis, e-commerce personalization, and countless other applications. Understanding this evolution is critical for designing systems that meet modern demands.
